/**
 * Utility for consolidating multiple scattered state variables into a single UiState data class.
 *
 * This helps reduce recomposition overhead when screens have many independent state variables.
 *
 * Instead of:
 * ```kotlin
 * var dialogShown by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
 * var dialogTitle by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
 * var dialogMessage by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
 * var selectedItem by remember { mutableStateOf<Item?>(null) }
 * var isEditing by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
 * // ... 50+ more state variables
 * ```
 *
 * Use:
 * ```kotlin
 * data class ScreenUiState(
 *     val dialogShown: Boolean = false,
 *     val dialogTitle: String = "",
 *     val dialogMessage: String = "",
 *     val selectedItem: Item? = null,
 *     val isEditing: Boolean = false,
 * )
 *
 * var uiState by rememberScreenState { ScreenUiState() }
 *
 * // Update single field
 * uiState = uiState.copy(dialogShown = true)
 *
 * // Update multiple fields
 * uiState = uiState.copy(
 *     dialogShown = true,
 *     dialogTitle = "Confirm",
 *     dialogMessage = "Are you sure?"
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Reduces recomposition scope (only composables reading changed fields recompose)
 * - Easier to track state changes
 * - Better IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)
 * - Cleaner code
