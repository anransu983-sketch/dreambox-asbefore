package com.suanran.dreambox.runtime.service.session.spec

/**
 * Service-process holder for the compiled config's `tun.include-package` / `tun.exclude-package`
 * lists.
 *
 * Single writer: [CompiledConfigPipeline] publishes via [update] after a successful native
 * compile-and-load, and [SessionRuntime] clears via [clear] on core teardown so a stale profile's
 * lists never leak into the next session. Single reader: [VpnTunTransport] reads the lists at
 * `VpnService.Builder.establish()` time to apply per-app routing.
 *
 * This state is deliberately kept in-process (service process only) and NOT in the multi-process
 * ServiceStore MMKV: the compiled config is loaded and consumed in the same process, and the lists
 * must always mirror the currently loaded config, not a persisted snapshot.
